# PhenoScale PAM documentation hub

This repository is the documentation and orientation hub for the PhenoScale acoustic monitoring effort at Wytham Woods. It links to code, data locations, and short how-tos.

## What this repo contains
- High-level info and handoff notes: `HANDOFF.md`
- Detailed docs: `docs/`
- Logger metadata: `metadata/`
- Small utility scripts: `scripts/`

## Quick links
- phenoscale-pilot — data processing and analysis: https://github.com/nilomr/phenoscale-pilot
- perch-cpu-inference — embedding & inference tooling: https://github.com/nilomr/perch-cpu-inference
- AudioMoth-Wytham-Woods — device firmware and configs: https://github.com/nilomr/AudioMoth-Wytham-Woods

## Quickstart — get oriented (5–30 minutes)
1. Read `HANDOFF.md` for immediate next steps and access requirements.
2. Open `docs/index.md` for the table of contents and where to find more details.
3. If you need data: see `docs/0-data-access.md` to request or mount the project dataset.

## If you're taking over
- Confirm you have read access to the data and to the three linked repos.
- Run the quick validation steps listed in the repo where the code lives (see `perch-cpu-inference` and `phenoscale-pilot`).
- Document any changes back into `HANDOFF.md` in this repo.

## Where to look next
- `docs/` — Detailed on-boarding, data specs, processing notes, and analysis ideas.
- `metadata/` — Logger inventory and mapping files.

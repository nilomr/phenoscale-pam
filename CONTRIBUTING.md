# Contributing to Phenoscale PAM

This repository serves as documentation and a handoff center for the Phenoscale PAM project. Contributions should maintain its accuracy and usefulness for both maintainers and users.

## Ways to Contribute

- Update or expand handoff instructions in `HANDOFF.md`.
- Enhance or add checklists and documentation in the `docs/` directory.
- Include links to additional active repositories, datasets, or dashboards.

## Typical Development Process

1. Open an issue describing the proposed change.
2. Submit a pull request with focused, incremental updates.
3. Tag the project maintainer and at least one reviewer for review. Chances are that will be you on both counts, my condolences.

## Getting Help

- Reach out to the project lead or team for broader questions. Project lead: Ben Sheldon, University of Oxford.
- Contact the previous maintainer: nilomr (GitHub: [@nilomr](https://github.com/nilomr)) for internal handover inquiries *if absolutely necessary*.

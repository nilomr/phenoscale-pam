# Quickstart checklist

Welcome! here are a few things that you can do to get started:

- [ ] Read `HANDOFF.md` and `README.md`.
- [ ] Fork, clone [or get granted access to] these repositories and credentials:
  - [`phenoscale-pilot`](https://github.com/nilomr/phenoscale-pilot): For reference, this is the pilot we run in 2024 across these sites ([video](https://youtu.be/zkot0ddscpQ)).
  - [`perch-cpu-inference`](https://github.com/nilomr/perch-cpu-inference): High-performance acoustic data embedding extraction and classification.
  - [`AudioMoth-Wytham-Woods`](https://github.com/nilomr/AudioMoth-Wytham-Woods/tree/dev/bats): Custom AudioMoth firmware.
- [ ] Obtain access to data and computational resources. Confirm permissions to read/write from the data and compute servers (see [docs/data-access.md](/docs/data-access.md)).
